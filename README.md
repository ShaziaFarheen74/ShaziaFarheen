FLAMES GAME

The FLAMES game uses a simple algorithm based on the names provided. It counts the unique letters and determines the relationship type based on the count.

This project implements the classic "FLAMES" game, which determines the relationship between two names based on a fun calculation. The webpage allows users to input their names and see the result, styled with HTML and CSS, while the logic is handled using Python.
