index.html (for the HTML structure)
styles.css (for styling)
app.py (for the Python backend)
static/ (folder for CSS and JS files)
templates/ (folder for HTML templates)

Step 2: Create the HTML Structure
In index.html, set up the basic structure of the webpage.

Step 3: Style Your Page
In styles.css, add some basic styles to make your page look nicer.

Step 4: Implement the FLAMES Logic in Python
